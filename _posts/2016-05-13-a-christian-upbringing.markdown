I was born into religion. My mum attended an [Assemblies of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblies_of_God) church, and I went along with her every Sunday. Dad wasn't generally interested in church for most of my childhood. Eventually he became a Christian too, and would come along with mum, my younger sibling, and myself.

Assemblies of God churches are [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) and believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. So this church practised "speaking in tongues", and the various other activities that go along with that.

As a child I asked a _lot_ of "why" and "how" questions. It seems to me all children do this, but if the stories are to be believed, I went over and above the normal quota. When I was very young, the answers mum would give to my faith-based questions were mostly adequate, and when they weren't we turned to the bible for clarification. As I got older, church youth leaders and elders managed to, for the most part, satisfy my enquiries.

At this stage, my questions were generally relating to the nature of church, religion, and our relationship with God in comparison with what is taught in the bible. Questioning some Pentecostal practices, questioning religious traditions, and generally feeling that the churches I saw around me didn't look much like the church Jesus had taught of in the bible.

I was fascinated by the story of creation and the story of revelations. At one point I attended a seminar by Ken Ham on creation science. I read through the Left Behind series of Christian fiction. It was all wonderful stuff to try and wrap my head around. And ultimately I felt I had a pretty good handle on things. I'd adapted my belief system to be my own, rather than the one directly handed to me, and I felt it was largely defensible. Both from Christians who I felt had it wrong, and from non-Christians who I felt also had it wrong.

By the time I was hitting my mid-twenties, I'd stopped attending church but still identified as a Christian. It seemed to me that churches weren't what Jesus had intended them to be. For the next few years, I largely put Christianity out of my mind, other than the occasional interaction with a friend or colleague where it would come up. Until one evening I was having  a chat with some mates at the pub, and while I held my own in the conversation, I left thinking that I really needed to look into this more thoroughly and draw a line in the sand. Was Christianity really a defensible position to hold?
