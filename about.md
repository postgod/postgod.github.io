title: About

Raised in a Christian home and attending church, eventually my questions led me to start seriously investigating the efficacy of my faith. Over the next 10 years, I gradually unravelled it between periods of setting the problem aside altogether, until drawing a line in the sand at the end of 2015. At this point, I would roughly describe myself as an empirically scientifically skeptical agnostic atheist.

I'd like to write some of my thoughts on this process, religion, and post-religion life in this blog.

I've chosen to leave the blog relatively anonymous in terms of not using real names, though some of the content may give an indication of my identity to a reader familiar enough with me or my life.
